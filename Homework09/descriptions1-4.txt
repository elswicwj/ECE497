1. Connect is called at first and the 'matrix' message is sent to the bone. The bone reacts by 
reading all the LED registers from the matrix and reconstructing its state in the browser.
When it does so, it hard codes each member of the matrix to call LEDclick() whenever each one
is clicked which its x and y index as arguments. It then toggles the LED by sending the 'i2cset'
message and then it updates the browser display.

2. When an LED is clicked in the browser, LEDclick is called with the LED clicked's coordinates, 
as the arguments as defined in the HTML code which builds the LED matrix in the browser.

3. .on is the original entry in the css used to color the LEDs. I have split this us into 
on_green, on_red, and on_yellow for my code.

4. On its first connection, the browser will connect to the bone and soon send the 'matrix' message
which will read the status of the LED matrix and reconstruct its state in the browser.

Whenever an LED is clicked, the browser will call LEDclick on the bone. This will in turn check
the current status of the LED and move it to the next state or status in the sequence:

off->green->red->yellow->back to off

then send the 'i2cset' message to update the LED matrix. Immediately after this, the status will 
be checked again and the matrix in the browser will be changed to reflect the new status of the 
real LEDs.
