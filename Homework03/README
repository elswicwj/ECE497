Homework 3.
Created by Will Elswick 9/23/2013 using gedit.

In this repository are the 2 programs I have written for homework 3.
There is one in each of the two repositories. Use the 'make' command
to create the executable in each folder.

I also created a device .dts file to use with the pins I selected that configures
all the pins to have pull-down resistors. This is included in the 'device tree' directory.

Part01
--------
Usage: %s <sensor 1 low threshold> <sensor 1 high threshold> <sensor 2 low threshold> <sensor 2 high threshold>
This program uses temperatures in Fahrenheit.
This program takes the values for the high and low threshold registers in the TMP101 sensors.
Then, when either device throws an alarm, the program will print out the temperature they are reading

Part02
--------
Usage: %s <start x> <start y> <low temperature threshold> <high temperature threshold>
This program uses temperatures in Celsius.
This program takes the start position for the cursor on the etch a sketch. The program will then display the
board on the console and the LED matrix and can be controlled with the 4 buttons selected by the #defines in
the program. The screen can be cleared or erase mode can be toggled by the last two GPIO pins. These
pins I have hooked up to the alarm pins of my TMP101 sensors and are triggered in the same manner as Part01.
